### Is this thing on? 

Perhaps you've followed a link to a Jupyter notebook and want to try running the code. But when you click a cell, or hit **Shift+Enter**, nothing happens. Why?

Notebooks can be viewed as static (read-only) documents, or run as live (interactive) resources. Static versions are just web pages, there's no computing environment sitting underneath for the code to run in. Both GitHub and NBViewer display static versions of Jupyter notebooks.

But don't worry, it's easy to shift from a static view to a live environment using Binder.

### Opening a notebook in Binder

Binder is a cloud-based service that creates customised computing environments for Jupyter notebooks to run in. You give Binder a list of the software you need and it spins up a server ready to go.

## What is a Jupyter notebook?

Distinguish between the notebook format and the software used for viewing or running.

## Why are they useful?

* reproducibility
* exploration
* learning
* tool and tutorial

## What do you need to get started?

Nothing -- Binder & cloud services
