# Te Papa collections API

Te Papa has a [very well-documented API](https://data.tepapa.govt.nz/docs/index.html) that provides rich information about its collection and the relationships between collection items and other entities, including people and places.

You'll need [an API key](https://data.tepapa.govt.nz/docs/register.html) for serious exploration.
