The proceedings of Australia's Commonwealth Parliament are recorded in Hansard, which is available online through the Parliamentary Library's [ParlInfo](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;query=Dataset:hansardr,hansardr80;resCount=Default) database. This repository includes Jupyter notebooks to harvest and explore XML formatted versions of Hansard.

You can access a [full harvest of the XML files for both houses between 1901 and 1980](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml) from this repository.

The XML files are made available on the Australian Parliament website under a CC-BY-NC-ND licence.

## Tools, tips, and examples

### [Harvesting Commonwealth Hansard](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/australian-commonwealth-hansard/blob/master/Harvesting-Commonwealth-Hansard.ipynb)
Results in ParlInfo are generated from well-structured XML files which can be downloaded individually from the web interface â€“ one XML file for each sitting day. This notebook shows you how to download all the XML files for large scale analysis. It's an updated version of the code I used to harvest Hansard in 2016.
