# Welcome to the wonderful world of GLAM data!

Here you’ll find a collection of tools and examples to help you work with data from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector), focusing on Australia and New Zealand.

## What is GLAM data?

When we talk about GLAM data we’re usually referring to the collections held by cultural institutions &ndash; books, manuscripts, photographs, objects, and much more. We’re used to exploring these collections through online search interfaces or finding aids, but sometimes we want to do more &ndash; instead of a list of search results on a web page, we want access to the underlying collection data for analysis, enrichment, or visualisation. We want [collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/).

This GLAM Workbench shows you how to create your own research datasets from a variety of GLAM collections. In some cases cultural institutions provide direct access to collection data through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or data downloads. In other cases we have to find ways of extracting data from web interfaces &ndash; a process known as screen-scraping. Here you’ll find examples of all these approaches, as well as links to a number of pre-harvested datasets.

## What can I do with GLAM data?

Ask different types of questions!

* Shift scales
* Find patterns
* Extract features
* Make connections

This GLAM Workbench demonstrates a variety of tools and techniques that you can use to explore your data.

## Do I need to be able to code?

No, you can use the Jupyter notebooks within the workbench without any coding experience &ndash; just edit and click where indicated. But every time you do edit one of the notebooks, you *are* coding. The notebooks provide an opportunity to gain confidence and experiment. They might not turn you into a coder, but they will show you how to do useful things with code.
