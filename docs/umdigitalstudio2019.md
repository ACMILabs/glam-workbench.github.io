# GLAM data workshop

Morning: 10-12.30

Afternoon: 1.30-4.00

Create a new getting started repo containing:

* Blank versions of notebooks
* Trove over time
* Trove by state
* Trove Harvester
* NAA series harvester

Git Fork and Clone into Tinker

## Activity 1 – Seeing differently

### Part 1

1. What do you know about Trove’s newspapers?
2. Open up the Newspapers home page.
3. Search for something you’re interested in.
4. What do we know about that search? What’s in the results? How do they change over time? What’s missing?

### Part 2

1. Go to [QueryPic Deconstructed](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FQueryPic_deconstructed.ipynb). (It might take a little while to load – just be patient!)
2. Enter your Trove API key and search term.
3. Click **Create chart**.
3. Anything interesting or unexpected?
4. Try searching for multiple terms?
5. What has changed from the standard search interface? How might you use this in your own research?

## Collections as data

We already use GLAM collections in our research, why would we want to access and analyse GLAM data directly? Why would we want [collections as data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/)?

* Shift scales
* Find patterns
* Extract features
* Make connections

The [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.github.io/) is not about specific tools or technologies, it’s about introducing opportunities for seeing GLAM collections differently. It’s a collection of examples for you to use, change, and hopefully learn from.

Here’s a 7 minute intro to the GLAM Workbench…

And here's [a slightly longer discussion](https://vimeo.com/350981680) of some of the possibilities of working with collections as data…

## What is GLAM data?

Yes there are overlaps…

Questions about access and usability…

What makes data usable?

* Metadata (not content)
* Unstructured text
* Structured text / data
* Images
* Derived
* User generated
* Activity

### Metadata

Data about data! In regards to GLAM collections we’re probably talking about the sorts of descriptive information you might find in a catalogue or collection database rather than the digitised objects themselves.

**Examples:**

* [Closed Access](http://closedaccess.herokuapp.com/) – What files in the National Archives of Australia are closed to public access? What can we know about what we’re not allowed to see? You can harvest your own dataset [using this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/recordsearch/blob/master/harvest_closed_files.ipynb). Datasets from [2017](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5900125.v1), [2016](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4530851.v1), and [2015](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2060052.v1) are available on Figshare.
* [Trove Maps](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-maps/) – What’s there and how big is it?

### Structured data or text

Think spreadsheets.

**Examples:**

* [GLAM CSV Explorer](https://glam-workbench.github.io/csv-explorer/) – Play with more than [500 GLAM datasets](https://glam-workbench.github.io/glam-data-portals/) harvested from government data portals. Here’s a [big human-readable list](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/glam-data-list/blob/master/glam_datasets_from_datagovau.md) of the datasets.
* [NSW State Archives online indexes](https://glam-workbench.github.io/nsw-state-archives/) – 64 indexes containing 1,499,259 rows of data!

## Unstructured text

**Examples:**

* Commonwealth Hansard, 1901–80 – Perhaps this is structured unstructured text?
* [Trove journals](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-journals/) – Get your bulk downloads here!

### Unpacking interfaces & thinking critically

* Trove over time
* Trove by state
* Naturalisations? NMA API?

### Seeing things differently

* Time
* Places
* Words

## Afternoon

### Handy hints

### Getting data

* APIs — NMA
* Downloads (automated) — Journal covers
* Scraping (harvest NAA series)
* Other tools?

### Diving deep

Trove Harvester (or NAA)
Analyse texts


### What did you find?
